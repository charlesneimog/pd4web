# <h1 align="center">Template <code>3</code>: Choir and Phones</h1>


This template is just a reuse of the template used in the pieces `Moteto (2023)` and `Pandemônico (2024)`. Pieces for choir and smartphone. Where you can do some patch with guide notes (or just the score) for the singer.

The result will be something like this:

In your patch, you have these options to set using **senders**:

- `composer`: The composer name;
- `title`: Title of the piece;
- `duration-bar`: A number between 0 and 100 for the bar line.
- `piece-duration-bar`: A number between 0 and 100 for the bar line.
- `poem-phrase`: The complete phrase of the poem (or anything else), for example `minha frase`.
- `pitch-syl`: A list with the pitchname and the syllable, for example `C4 fra`.

In your patch, you have these options to set using **receivers**:

- `naipe`. Receive the naipe choosen by the singer, 1 for Baixo, 2 for Tenor, 3 for Contralto and 4 for Soprano.
