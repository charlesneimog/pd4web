!!! bug "How to report?"
    Create a new issue on [GitHub](https://github.com/charlesneimog/pd4web/issues/new){target="_blank"} (requires a GitHub account).

If this happens, it’s probably because your patch uses an object that I don’t use in my patches. To resolve the issue, you need to report it to me.

When reporting, you **must include the patch that is causing the problem**, because without it, I cannot solve the issue. You can always reduce the patch to the minimal size that reproduces the problem.

Usually, these issues are accompanied by an error related to the `flutex.c` file.
